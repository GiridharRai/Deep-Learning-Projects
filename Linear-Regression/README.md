# Linear Regression Projects

This folder contains a collection of Linear Regression projects I've worked on. Following is the list of projects
and their brief description.

### 1. Brain Weight Prediction
In this project, I've made a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn machine learning library to predict the brain weight
of a mammal from it's body weight.

### 2. Life Expectancy Prediction
In this project, a linear regression model has been implemented and trained on average life expectancy and mean BMI of males data of various countries. The model will be used to predict the life expectancy of Laos.

### 3. Boston House Prices
In this project, a linear regression model has been implemented and trained on Boston house prices dataset to find the linear relationship between multiple independent variables and single dependent variable.
